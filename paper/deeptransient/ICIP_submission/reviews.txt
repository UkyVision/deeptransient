Comment:    
 
1. Confidence (How confident are you in your assessment of the paper?)
  Confident(2)  
2. Importance/Relevance
  Of broad interest (4)   It is good and expected to see that deep learning is
                          effective in solving more and more vision problems.
3. Novelty/Originality
  Moderately original (3)   The main contribution of this paper is to apply the
                            popular deep learning techniques to transient attribute 
                            prediction and weather classification.
4. Technical correctness
  Probably correct (did not checked completly) (3)
    The implementation of the training system is built on Caffe. The authors
    promise to release the network models so there should be no problem to repeat
    the experiments.
5. Experimental validation
  Limited but convincing (3)  
6. Presentation
  Clear enough (3)  
7. References
  References adequate (3)

Comment:  This paper introduces six deep convolutional neural networks for
predicting transient scene attributes from a single image. These networks
achieve state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets. The key advantages
of the proposed approach are that it requires no hand-engineered features, is
simple to train, is very fast at test time, and makes accurate predictions. In
addition, these networks can quickly extended to label additional attributes or
adapted to new datasets with a small amount of retraining. In addition, the
paper also proposes a method for automatically labeling outdoor webcams using
these networks.
